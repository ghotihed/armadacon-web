        <h1 align="left">Frequently Asked Questions </h1><br/>
        <h3 align="left">Section 1: Conventions in General</h3>
        <h4 align="left">What are Conventions?</h4>
        Conventions are organized events where like minded people gather to interact with each other on a given subject. The subject could be anything, Sci-Fi is only one subject of many different types of convention that are held across the world.
          <h4 align="left">When did Conventions start?</h4>
<br />
            The origins of conventions have been lost to the mists of time, but suffice to say they've been going for longer than many people think. One popular notion is that conventions started with the advent of Star Trek in the 1960's. This isn't true; there's evidence that conventions were running as early as the 1930's in the UK and the USA!
        <h4 align="left">How popular are Conventions?</h4>
        <br />
        It's estimated that there's several conventions held every weekend somewhere in the world. Sci-Fi conventions are by far the most common.
        <h4 align="left">What happens at Conventions?</h4>
    <br />
          In the early days, the likes of writers and film makers would go to these conventions to swop ideas and discuss various aspects of a given topic. <br />
        Since the advent of television, conventions have evolved radically. These events are now more fan orientated. Conventions are opportunities for fans of a writer, film or TV series to meet the people who appear on the silver screen or TV tube. What actually happens differs from convention to convention, but that sums it up in a nutshell.
        <h4 align="left">Are Conventions like I've seen In Galaxy Quest and The Simpsons?</h4>
        <br />
        Some are, but most aren't. Don't forget, these two shows were poking fun at conventions, so things were exagerated somewhat. Yes, some of imagery and characters portrayed were accurate, but the numbers involved are nowhere near the truth. Virtually all the people go to conventions are normal everyday human beings.

        <h3 align="left">Section 2: Fans and Fandom</h3>
        <h4 align="left"><br />
          What is a Fan?</h4>
    <br />
          A fan is a person who takes an interest in the work of another person or persons. This work could be anything from watching plays written by Shakespeare, to following a given football team. Being a fan goes beyond simply liking something. A fan of classical music will have many copies of the same piece, but performed by different orchestras. A fan of a football team will often own the team strip or other items.
        <h4 align="left">What is Fandom?</h4>
        <br />
        Fandom is the generic term for the fans of a given subject. For example; the football team Manchester United has many fans, or Manchester United has its fandom. What is interesting to note, is that many TV Soaps have their fans, but there's no predefined fandom for them.
        <h4 align="left">Can Sci-Fi Fans tell the difference between fact and fantasy?</h4>
        <br />
        In a single word &quot;Yes&quot; and they can do it better than most people. What you've heard is the outpourings from the less intelligent areas of the media. This media will devote enormous amounts of time and energy in reporting the latest gossip in the Soaps, then they'll poke fun at someone wearing a Star Trek shirt! Have you ever noticed throughout the years that fans of Soaps will send flowers when a CHARACTER dies, or buy a wedding special when two CHARACTERS get married? The irony is that it's these same people that accuse Sci-Fi fans of being unable to tell fact from fantasy!
        <h4 align="left">Do Sci-fi Fans dress up and pretend to be Captain Kirk?</h4>
        <br />
        Do children re-enact what they see on TV? Do football fans play football while wearing their favorite team strip and pretend to be their favorite player? Do we all fantasize about being somebody else at times? Of course we do. Sci-Fi fans are no different, so the answer to your question is yes. Mind you, please don't think that ALL Sci-Fi fans like Captain Kirk; some dress up and take the mickey out of him!
        <h4 align="left">Why does the Press portray Fans as people who don't have a life?</h4>
        <br />
        The popular daily press doesn't care about people. They only want to sell papers. Therefore they pick on minority groups and hold them up to ridicule. Can you imagine what would happen if the papers mocked people who watched Eastenders and Coronation Street? Yup, sales would plummet! Many fans have learned to avoid talking to the popular press. In fact, some conventions even print warnings about the press in their literature!

        <h3 align="left">Section 3: ArmadaCon</h3>
        <h4 align="left"><br />
          What is ArmadaCon?</h4>
    <br />
          ArmadaCon is Sci-Fi and Fantasy Multi Media Convention that's been running in Plymouth since 1988.
        <h4 align="left">Why Multi Media?</h4>
        <br />
        Other conventions tend to be focused one medium or one subject within that medium. We've found that fans find this format restrictive as most fans like more than one type of medium irrespective of subject matter.
        <h4 align="left">Why do you describe yourselves as 'unconventional'?</h4>
        <br />
        Many modern conventions have become very professional. They're slickly presented and well polished events. This type of convention is considered the norm. Fans go to these conventions to be entertained by the guests. ArmadaCon is completely different; most attendees come to entertain each other!
        <h4 align="left">Fans entertaining each other? I don't understand.</h4>
        <br />
        It's true. Sci-Fi fans are an outgoing bunch and they don't take themselves too seriously. ArmadaCon provides the opportunity for these people to put on events that might never see the light of day anywhere else.
        <h4 align="left">You don't seem to have any big names as guests, why?</h4>
        <br />
        We've found that they're not as interesting as the minor league ones. The more well known people have told their stories many times over and so they don't come across as well. Since ArmadaCon is a Multi Media Convention, we like to have guests from behind the camera as well such as writers etc.
        <h4 align="left">Your ticket price is more expensive than other Cons. Why's that?</h4>
        <br />
        Don't be fooled by events that have 'cheap' ticket prices. They have hidden extras, we don't. Our guests don't usually charge for autographs. Our guests aren't hidden away in a 'Green Room'. It's perfectly normal for our guests to be having informal chats with the attendees in the bar, etc. With that level of access, we actually work out cheaper!

<!--
        <h4 align="left">How come I've not heard of ArmadaCon before?</h4>
        <br />
      When did you last see an advert for Rolls Royce cars? Chances are that you never have. Good things tend to advertise themselves. ArmadaCon works in much the same way, that's by word of mouth. Don't get me wrong, we do advertise, but it's selective. Because of our venue, we have to limit the numbers that we can take.
