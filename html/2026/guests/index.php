                        Jonny Nexus has been writing SF and fantasy in various forms since creating a cult RPG humour
                        webzine, <em>Critical Miss</em>, in the late '90s. Having since self-published four novels
                        (<em>Game Night</em>, his tale of dysfunctional role-playing gods, <em>If Pigs Could Fly</em>
                        and <em>Sticks and Stones</em> of the <em>West Kensington Paranormal Detective Agency Series</em>,
                        and <em>The Sleeping Dragon</em>), he now has an agent, John Jarrold, but not yet a publishing
                        contract. He’s been attending various SF conventions since the 2008 Eastercon, Odyssey. (You
                        might well have bought a book from him.) He’s long stated that his ambition in writing is
                        neither fame nor fortune, but simply being able to describe himself as a writer without
                        feeling the need to deploy either quotes or a footnote.
