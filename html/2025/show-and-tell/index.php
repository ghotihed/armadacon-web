            Dawn Abigail has been going to SF conventions for over twenty years. But she has been writing poetry even
            longer. Dawn’s poetry tends to fall under one of three categories: ‘Deep and Meaningful’, ‘Ranty’, or
            very, very silly.
        </p>

            Dawn has been published in <em>People to People</em> magazine, and was recently chosen to contribute to
            the Zephaniah Forest’s <em>Poetree Trail</em>.  A long-term collaboration with calligrapher and illustrator
            Gwyneth Hibbett has produced two beautifully illustrated collections
            (<em>Deeply Meaningful Poetry for Very Serious People</em> and <em>A Companion to the Long, Dark Night</em>)
            as well as individual lettered artworks.  Dawn and Gwyn are delighted to be bringing their new
            micro-fiction exhibition, <em>Show and Tell</em> to the 2025 Armadacon.
