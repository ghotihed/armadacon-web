                        Dominic Glynn is a composer whose career began back in 1986 when he became one of the few people
                        to arrange the theme tune to the classic TV series <em>Doctor Who</em>. He reworked the famous
                        theme that accompanied Colin Baker's Doctor, and composed incidental music for the series
                        throughout the late 1980s. As one of Britain's most prolific composers of production music, his
                        work can also be heard in hundreds of films and TV productions worldwide, as diverse as
                        <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Red Dwarf</em>, and <em>Dead Like Me</em>. He scored music for video
                        games, performed live at the London's Royal Festival Hall, collaborated with video artists, and
                        released records of electronic dance music.
