        <p>
            This year's theme for cosplay is <strong>Anniversaries</strong>.
            Lots of anniversaries with round numbers are worth considering in 2023:

        <p>
            Of course, there's no reason you should limit yourself to a round number. Some really great things
            have round-ish anniversaries (like <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>'s 45<sup>th</sup>
            anniversary or <em>The War of the Worlds</em>'s 125<sup>th</sup> anniversary).
        </p>
        <p>
            What other anniversaries can you think of?

                            It’s almost the End of the World, but with Pimm’s on the patio, video games and working in his pants – Dave’s having a great apocalypse.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Until the return-to-work order shatters his peace.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dawn holds her own – just – as the last woman alive (West Midlands Emergency Area) in a secret
                            bunker.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dave needs more than air pods and sharp elbows to endure his heroic journey to the office as he
                            battles the worst commuters known to man – hordes of shambling zombies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And Dawn discovers that saving the world is part of her job description.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Will Dave make it to the office on time for the team meeting?</strong>

                        <p>
                            Take a riotous, satirical trip through undead-infested Birmingham with this hilarious zombie romantic comedy.

                            catapulted into a strange investigation, and learns that Anna may be able to help her uncover

                            threats.
