        <p>When we meet at ArmadaCon this year, the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who will be fast approaching. If you like
            making things from yarn, perhaps you would like to join with THE SCARF!</p>

        <p>We are inviting anyone who wants to to start knitting, crocheting, macrameing…</p>

        <p>You choose the colour. You choose the thickness of the yarn. Use scraps or whole balls. Just so long as the
            width is 25cm.</p>

        <h3>The length?</h3>
        <div id="scarf-image"><img width="200" src="scarf.jpg" alt="Scarf"/></div>

        <p>Well, how far can we go? The world record for a single scarf is 4565.46 metres.</p>

        <p>We're aiming for a <b>60 for the 60th</b> theme. Can we reach 60 feet? Can we reach 60 yards? How about being
            able
            to drape the scarf around 60 conventioneers?</p>

        <p>If you want to start now — I have — you can bring your length of scarf with you to the con. We can carry on
            at the con at HP Lunchcraft and any odd moments. Everyone will have the chance of contributing, even if only
            by one stitch.</p>

        <p>Materials will be available at the con. The only ask is for you to please sew your ends in! My piece is
            chunky yarn, 35 stitches in knit (garter) stitch on 5.5 mm needles.</p>

        <p>And in the best Armadacon tradition of, say, a Star Trek wrist communicator, the scarf may just return year
            after year! We might just get to that world record, yet!</p>
