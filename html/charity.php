            For many years ArmadaCon supported the RNIB Talking Books Service. To find out
            more about the books that we have had transcribed, please have a look at the
            <a href="https://www.armadacon.org/archive/Charity.html" target="_new">Charity page of the
                ArmadaCon On-Line Archive</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to some changes in the way RNIB works and the fact that we reached a
            significant anniversary at ArmadaCon 25, the attendees were asked which charity they would like
            to support, and St Luke's was chosen.

            St Luke&rsquo;s Hospice provides specialist end of life care to over 3,500
            patients a year from across Plymouth, South West Devon and East Cornwall.
            The aim of their teams is to provide the highest quality of care to alleviate
            pain and distressing symptoms, offering practical, emotional and spiritual support to patients,
            their families and their carers.
        </p>
        <p>They care for people with serious illnesses such as cancer, motor neurone
            disease, heart failure, multiple sclerosis and chronic lung disease, treating any adult over the
            age of 18. They do all they can to involve patients in decisions about their care, to maintain
            privacy and dignity in providing that care and to respect patients&rsquo; individual rights and
            religious and cultural beliefs. Their approach to care is holistic, centred on the needs of the
            individual patient.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have been offering their care to patients from across Plymouth, South West
            Devon and East Cornwall, for over 30 years; wherever they need it most, whether in the home,
            hospital or hospice and their teams of specialist doctors, nurses, occupational therapists and
            social workers make this possible.
