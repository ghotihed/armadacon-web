            <h3>A Message from St. Luke&rsquo;s</h3>
            <p>
                I just wanted to send you a little message to say thank you again for your tremendous support of
                St Luke&rsquo;s. Yet again the amazing Armadacon Community has gone above and beyond in supporting us. I
                was delighted to do the cheque presentation with you so that everyone who supports us so generously
                every year could be a part of it, please send the pictures when you are able to as I would love to
                give you a shout-out in our social media.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your generosity over the years has meant that more than fifteen patients and their families have
                received the care and support they really need in their darkest hours, and for that we will be
                forever grateful.
            </p>
            <p>
                I look forward to seeing you all again next year and will definitely spend the whole day as its
                undoubtedly one of my favourite events of the year when I get to meet such wonderful people,
                (and orcs or course).
            </p>

        <p>
            St Luke&rsquo;s Hospice provides specialist end of life care to over 3,500
            patients a year from across Plymouth, South West Devon and East Cornwall.
            The aim of their teams is to provide the highest quality of care to alleviate
            pain and distressing symptoms, offering practical, emotional and spiritual support to patients,
            their families and their carers.
        </p>
        <p>They care for people with serious illnesses such as cancer, motor neurone
            disease, heart failure, multiple sclerosis and chronic lung disease, treating any adult over the
            age of 18. They do all they can to involve patients in decisions about their care, to maintain
            privacy and dignity in providing that care and to respect patients&rsquo; individual rights and
            religious and cultural beliefs. Their approach to care is holistic, centred on the needs of the
            individual patient.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have been offering their care to patients from across Plymouth, South West
            Devon and East Cornwall, for over 30 years; wherever they need it most, whether in the home,
            hospital or hospice and their teams of specialist doctors, nurses, occupational therapists and
            social workers make this possible.
