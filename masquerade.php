        <h1 class="page-title">Masquerade Guidance</h1>
        <p>
            All costumes will be marked in two categories: Style and Presentation.
            Style is the look of the costume, simply put, how good it looks.
            Presentation covers the delivery of the costume; the atmosphere it creates. The use of dialogue (song and
            dance routines, kitchen sinks, etc) to 'sell' the costume is hunky-dory.

        </p>

        <h2>The rules are as follows:</h2>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                Costumes need not be the work of the person wearing it, but should NOT be commercial 'off the
                shelf' uniforms, etc
            </li>

            <li>
                If your entry involves a performance, you can use any props or costumes as you see fit.
                However, no pyrotechnics can be used without permission of the Committee
                (There are fire alarm sensors everywhere and your costume is liable to get
                pressure washed by the Fire Brigade).
            </li>

            <li>
                You are encouraged to provide your own backing music, etc, but please ensure that it can be played
                on a computer system (MP3, .WAV, etc). There will be a selection of backing music
                available at the Con, but the choice is limited.
            </li>

            <li>
                Where possible, please limit the duration of your entry to around three minutes. If your entry
                is likely to be longer, please tell the Committee so that they can poke members of the audience with a
                stick if they fall asleep.
            </li>

            <li>
                Since the Masquerade takes place before the 9pm watershed, please ensure your entry is of
                a suitable standard.
            </li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Bonus Awards</h2>
        <p>
            Although the Masquerade is geared towards the two primary categories, there is a third
            special award. If you have never entered the Con Masquerade before, then you will also be judged in the
            special category First Time Entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only a masquerade 'virgin' can win this category. As an extra bribe to break your duck,
            the prize is a free registration for the following Con.
