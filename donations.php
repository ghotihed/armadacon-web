        <h1 style="text-align: center">Donating and Selling Items</h1>
        <p>
            We give you different options to donate or sell your items. Here are the ways to do it and a few hints and
            tips which items to place where. If you have items to donate or sell, please think about where the items
            would fit best.
            Here is a short explanation of each of the possibilities:
        </p>

        <h2>The Main Auction</h2>
        <p>
            As usual we will have our main auction on Saturday afternoon. However we have implemented some changes to,
            hopefully, ensure that the two hours we allocate in the programme will not be too stretched!
            The main change is that only items without a reserve will be accepted for the Saturday afternoon auction.
            Lower value items can be put on to the Bring and Buy table, the Raffle, or the Sellers' Stall.
        </p>

        <h2>The Raffle</h2>
        <p>
            We will be running the Raffle again. Only donated items (i.e. no reserve) will be placed into the Raffle.
            Strange and wonderful things are to be won. We will be coming around during the weekend with tickets. The
            draw will be Sunday afternoon.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bring-and-Buy Table</h2>
        <p>
            If you have some lesser value Sci-Fi items that you would like to donate, then you can bring them to the Con
            and sell them via the Bring and Buy table.
        </p>

        <h2>The Seller's Stall</h2>
        <p>
            If you have any items you want some money back on, we will make a space available for you to sell your
            wares. Any donation to the auction proceeds are entirely at the seller's discretion.
            The Sellers’ Stall will be run by Cat and she will need you to fill out a form with your name, description
            of the item and how much you want to sell it for. This form will be part of the Con pack or can be picked up
            from the Reg desk.
            Please also put your name on a removable sticker onto the item, so we can identify which item belongs to
            you.

        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold">
            If you hand in items and don’t specify where you want your items to be placed, it will be placed at the
            committee's discretion.
