            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>
                ArmadaCon is a sci-fi and fantasy multimedia convention that's been running in Plymouth since 1988.
                While other conventions tend to be focused on one medium or one subject within that medium, we've
                found that fans find this format restrictive, as most fans like more than one type of medium,
                irrespective of subject. You can find out more on our <a href="about.html">about page</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>
                This year's guests are to be announced. As we gather people, we'll update this front page. More details
                will be available on the <a href="guests.html">guests page</a>.

            <h3>Where</h3>
            <p>
                For a while now, ArmadaCon has been meeting at the Future Inns hotel in Plymouth. All rooms have either
                two Canadian double beds or one Canadian double bed and one sofa bed. They are all en-suite and non-smoking.

                ArmadaCon gets a special room rate, though this does not include breakfast, which is an additional charge.
                More information can be found on the <a href="location.html">location page</a>.
