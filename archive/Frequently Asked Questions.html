  <p><span class="style2">Frequently Asked Questions</span></p>
  <p><span class="style3">What's this website all about then?</span><br />
  In short, it's an archive that lists the history of one series of conventions <br />
  (ArmadaCon) </p>
  <p><span class="style3">What is ArmadaCon?</span><br />
  ArmadaCon is Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Cult TV Multi Media Convention that's been running in <br />Plymouth since 1988.</p>
  <p><span class="style3">Why bother with an archive?</span><br />
  By luck, chance, and a little design; the organisers of ArmadaCon have amassed <br />
  over 3000 photos and over 100 hours of video footage of the activities that have taken place at the Cons <br />over the years. We feel that this achievement is unique and should be shared with <br />anyone who is interested.</p>
  <p><span class="style3">Where did the video footage come from?</span><br />
  When ArmadaCon II was being organised, someone had the idea of recording the <br />event on video and then selling edited copies on an official basis. This carried on for <br />a number of years, before the idea was dropped. A few years later, an attendee <br />recorded a Con for his own use. That attendee was approched by another attendee <br />who asked for a copy of the footage. Since then, that attendee has been recording <br />the Cons on an unofficial basis, and is still scrounging footage.</p>
  <p><span class="style3">Where did the 3000 photos come from?</span><br />
    This was a combination of scrounging and a gimmick. At one point, the official Con <br />
    website was run by a person who would ask other attendees for their photos for that <br />
    website. In return, that person would collate the donated photos, put them on a CD <br />
    and then give each of the donators a copy. In short, you could donate 50 photos, <br />but get 300 in return. Neat eh?<br />
  </p>
  <p><span class="style3">Will I find all of the photos and video on this website?</span><br />
  In short, no. The ArmadaCon archive has its own You Tube channel. There are links to   individual videos listed on the Convention pages. The photos aren't available   on-line; they have to be requested directly from the Archivist.<br />
  </p>
  <p><span class="style3">Can anyone have copies?</span><br />
    Nothing listed here is within the Public Domain. Although the videos listed on You Tube are freely available for anyone to enjoy;   the videos without links have to be requested from the archive. This is mostly   due to Copyright restrictions.<br />
  </p>
  <p><span class="style3">What are those tables under the convention notes all about?</span><br />
    They're an itemised catalogue of video footage held in the archive. If an event has <br />
    been transferred to disc, then the duration and file size is noted. A direct link to that video is also given in the You Tube column<br />
  </p>
  <p><span class="style3">Is it possible to get a copy of a file?</span><br />
    Yes it is, if you want a higher resolution (than the video on You Tube) </p>
  <p><span class="style3">If I have photos or video footage that you haven't got, would you be interested in it?</span><br />
    We most certainly would! We would be happy to negotiate a deal to obtain new <br />
  material. Please email the Archivist stating what you have and we're sure that something can be sorted out.</p>
