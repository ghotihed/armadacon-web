  <p><span class="style1">Logos over the Years</span></p>
  <p>Almost all organisations use a logo of some sort and ArmadaCon is no different.</p>
  <p>There was a period of time when the logo was changed for each convention. It was felt that it would freshen-up the look of each years convention website and  would be a bit of fun. </p>
  <p>Here's a list of those logos and some notes about each.</p>
  <table width="955" bordercolor="#000000">
    <tr>
      <td width="856"><div align="center"><img src="Images/generic.JPG" alt="earth globe and sailing ship" width="236" height="206" /></div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p align="center" class="style2">Generic</p>
        <p align="center">This was the first logo used and the one that's used most often. </p>
        <p align="center">The logo represents the Golden Hind orbiting the Earth; giving it a sci-fi overtone.</p>
      <p align="center"> Since the convention is held in Plymouth, where the English ships sailed to fight the Spanish Armada (hence Armada-Con); using the Golden Hind is rather apt. </p></td>

    <tr>
      <td><p align="center" class="style2">ArmadaCon 2001 </p>
        <p align="center">Since the year was 2001, the design was influenced by the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. </p>
      <p align="center">Out went the Discovery, and in came the Golden Hind. We had to keep the Monolith though; the logo wouldn't have been right without it!</p></td>

        <p align="center">The planet Mars has figured in science fiction many times over the years. Some of it was good, while other stuff was not so good! </p>

        <p align="center">In a sideways swipe at a book which appears at the ArmadaCon Turkey Readings (a flying cube), a flying mechanical sphere was used. </p>
        <p align="center">However, somebody saw it and thought it was a Borg Sphere. Fearing an attack by the Paramount lawyers, the logo had to be changed. </p>
      <p align="center">The logo designer was unaware that there was a Borg Sphere that appeared in Star Trek : Voyager at the time; as they  didn't watch it!</p></td>

        <p align="center" class="style4">The long   standing ship had now been replaced by a ships wheel to retain the nautical   theme, but placed in a celestial alignment with the Earth and the Sun to   continue the Sci-Fi theme.</p></td>
