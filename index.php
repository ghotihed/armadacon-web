	<h3>This years Masquerade.</h3>
        <p>One of the great things about a con is the chance for a little sartorial showing off and seeing the wonderful outfits that people have created.</p>

<p>So, we will be having a hall costume competition and everyone is invited to take part.</p>

<p>If you've already got something in mind that's fantastic, but, if you're not sure, how about our daily themes to challenge and inspire you...</p>

<p>Saturday - All Tomorrow’s Yesterdays</p>

<p>Lots of science fiction set in the future draws inspiration from the past. From Star Trek and Stargate's numerous alien cultures that mirrored ancient civilisations, via Rocket Robin Hood and the renaissance Italy stylings of Dune, to David Drake and David Webber's Napoleonic navies in space.</p>

<p>Dive in and show us your vision from All Tomorrow's Yesterdays*</p>

<p>Sunday - All Yesterday’s Tomorrows</p>

<p>There's nothing quite like putting a date on a piece of science fiction to err... date it.</p>

<p>1984, UFO, Space:1999, 2001, Back to the Future 2, Bladerunner, and so many more were set in what was, at the time, the future. Let's visit the Gernsback Continuum and all those visions of the future that weren't quite what came to pass.</p>

<p>Just do us a favour and steer clear of Star Trek's Patterns of Force*...</p>
<p>** No, we're not kidding - Please No Nazi's, they're verboten</p>
