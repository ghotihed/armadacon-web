        <p>Here is the bio she sent us:</p>
        <p>Liesel Schwarz is the   award-winning author of A Conspiracy of Alchemists, the first book in   her Chronicles of Light and Shadow Steampunk series.</SPAN></p>
        <p> A life-long fan of   19th Century Gothic literature, she is a hopeless romantic with a   penchant for everything that's odd from fairies to giant snarling   fantasy monsters.</p>
        <p> She is currently completing her PhD creative writing   at Brunel University and teaches creative writing in her spare time.</p>
        <p> She   really does live in a haunted stone cottage on the edge on an enchanted   forest and is definitely a cat person. And if you ask her nicely, she   might show you the correct way to drink absinthe</p>
