        <p class="BodyText">For many years ArmadaCon supported the RNIB Talking Books Service. To find out more about the books that we have had transcribed, please have a look at the <a href="http://www.armadacon.org/archive/Charity.html" target="_new">Charity page of the ArmadaCon On-Line Archive</a></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Due to some changes in the way RNIB works and the fact that we reached a significant anniversary. At ArmadaCon 25 the attendees were asked which charity they would like to support and St Luke's was chosen.</p>
